This Java program is a console application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a user database. It uses the User and UserDao classes to interact with the database.

The program starts by displaying a menu with six options: Create, Delete, Update, Find, FindEmail, and Exit. The showMenu() method displays the menu options, and the chooseMenuOption() method waits for user input and performs the corresponding action based on the selected option.

The createUser() method prompts the user to enter a new user's information, creates a new User object, and saves it to the database using the UserDao class's create() method.

The removeUser() method prompts the user to enter the user's ID to remove and deletes the user from the database using the UserDao class's delete() method.

The updateUser() method prompts the user to enter the user's ID to update and the new name, updates the user's name in the database using the UserDao class's update() method.

The findAll() method retrieves all users from the database using the UserDao class's findAll() method and displays them on the console.

The FindEmail option uses the UserDao class's findEmail() method to find all users with a specific email address and displays them on the console.

The program exits when the user selects the Exit option.

Overall, this program demonstrates the basic concepts of CRUD operations and database interaction in Java.
